Overview
========

PyMSG provides a Python interface to MSG (Multidimensional Stellar
Grids), a library that synthesizes astrophysical spectra and
photometric colors via interpolation in pre-calculated grids.  Given a
set of stellar atmospheric parameters (e.g., effective temperature,
gravity and metallicity), MSG can calculate the specific intensity of
the emergent radiation field as a function of wavelength and angle. It
can also convolve these data with appropriate filters and response
functions, to evaluate colors in a wide variety of photometric
systems.
